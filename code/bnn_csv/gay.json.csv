And I can't imagine it's been fun watching the man you love marginalized, under appreciated, and disrespected by the NYPD.  Kevin: Because he's gay, Raymond has been put through hell by his colleagues. Many of whom, quite frankly, look exactly like you.  Jake: Devastatingly handsome? I'm sorry. I'm uncomfortable with emotions.  Kevin: So, yes, I decided a long time ago, that just because I love Raymond, doesn't mean I have to love the people he works with. Good solve, detective.  Jake: Nice cop lingo.""}",

Captain Holt: Thinking of fresh insults? Not at all, you coffin cave mold beetle.  Madeline Wuntch: I meant our relationship. Aren't you tired of the rivalry? We fight and we fight, and nothing changes. But we're really not so different.  Captain Holt: I suppose we were close once. Remember Brighton Beach?  Madeline Wuntch: 1,200 kilos of heroin in an abandoned subway tunnel. How could I forget?  Captain Holt: The largest drug bust in NYPD history pulled off by a most unlikely duo.  Madeline Wuntch: A woman, and a gay, black detective.  Captain Holt: No, I meant a human and a rotted jack-o'-lantern.  Madeline Wuntch: Don't be so hard on yourself. You weren't all the way rotted back then.""}",

That's what you've been mad about all these years?  Captain Holt: It's one reason.  Madeline Wuntch: I don't care that you rejected my advances. Your sexual identity is the one thing I actually respect about you.  Captain Holt: Then what are you mad about?  Madeline Wuntch: I'm mad because you tried to get me thrown off the force.  Captain Holt: Yeah, because you shot me.  Madeline Wuntch: I shot you because you were in the wrong position. You weren't following orders.  Captain Holt: What about the time you destroyed my personnel file while I was undercover?  Madeline Wuntch: What if there had been a mole?  Captain Holt: You were trying to make me disappear.  Madeline Wuntch: You embarrassed me in front of Derek Jeter!  Captain Holt: You embarrassed yourself in front of Derek Jeter.""}",

Here.  Captain Holt: I think you should do this. You're more the biker type. I've seen you use a toothpick in public.  Sergeant Jeffords: Motorcycles are death machines. I have three kids. I'm not risking it.  Captain Holt: Are you saying my life matters less because I don't conform to society's heteronormative, child-centric ideals?

"{'Character': 'Captain Holt', 'Episode': 'Mr. Santiago', 'QuoteText': 'Captain Holt: My advice: don\'t be overconfident. The first time I met Kevin\'s parents, I called Brahm\'s ""Funf Gesange"" opus 106 when it is, obviously, opus 104. They haven\'t spoken to me since.  Jake: Really? Just for that?  Captain Holt: Yes. Also because they\'re huge homophobes who think that I made Kevin gay with my magic genitalia.  Jake: That\'s super sad, but I do like hearing you say the word ""genitalia"".'}",

Jake: Rosa, I don't think he was-  Captain Holt: No, I was. She saw right through me. Nevertheless, I will destroy you all.  Jake: Copy that. I love your intensity.""}",
"{'Character': 'Captain Holt', 'Episode': 'New Captain', 'QuoteText': ""Captain Holt: I came out as a gay cop in the 1980s, so it's going to take more than reassigning me to break my spirit. I'll turn this place around, just like I did the Nine-Nine.""}",

Jake: And that the only thing you're married to is banging married chicks.  The Vulture: Yeah, and I meant it all. But love? Love hath changed me.  Jake: No it hathn't. You just vultured our venue.  The Vulture: Yeah, but I did it for love. My fiance, she means everything to me.  You know, she's hot like a chick, she's smart like a guy. Just talking to her gives me a Harrelson.  Amy: Harrelson?

I understand how important these extravaganzas are. I'm sure you'll have a hoot.  Jake: Oh, yeah. Though I'm sure our hoots pale in comparison to the hoots that you had back in the day. I bet things got supes hoots.  Captain Holt: Actually, I wasn't privy to those events. As a gay black man I was excluded from most social gatherings.""}",
