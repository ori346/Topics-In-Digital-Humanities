"{'Character': 'Captain Holt', 'Episode': 'Bureau', 'QuoteText': 'Guard: Another Sex-and-the-Citiot?  Captain Holt: Guilty as charged. My favorite season has to be the third one. Everything was going right for Carrie. Her face was on every bus, her column was the talk of the town, and she met everyone\'s favorite furniture maker, Aidan Shaw. Sure, she melted down when he tried to introduce her to his parents, and she flipped out when she bumped into Big getting out of that cab with Natasha, whom he had married. Hmm.  Who can blame her? They barely knew each other. The best episode that year was episode six, entitled ""Are We Sluts?"" You know the one. Carrie was all in her head because she and Aidan weren\'t having sex. Meanwhile, across town, Charlotte couldn\'t stop having sex.  And Samantha? Samantha was just being Samantha. The season finale that year was entitled ""Cock-a-Doodle-Do.""'}",NO,
