Just wait till you're sitting fireside, sipping on a premium Chinese Scotch, and smoking a sweet Rwandan cigar.  Sergeant Jeffords: Okay. Okay. I probably could have done without the countries of origin, but that sounds great.""}",

Gina: You have a robust sense of self and are well suited to leadership positions. Characteristics: strength, determination, tenacity.  Captain Holt: Yes, I suppose that's accurate. They do call me Tenacious Ray down at the country club. Because for the past ten years I've been suing them for discrimination.""}",

Jake: First of all, my dream job is spy falsely accused of betraying his country, forced to work alone to clear his name by taking down the mysterious organization that framed him known only as S.H.A.D.E. Secondly, it wasn't a real job offer. She's up to something.""}",

Captain Holt: No one should have to suffer like this for me.  Charles: Suffer? This is a dream come true. It\'s a cross-country road trip. My dad and I took one every summer. You blast the ""Annie"" soundtrack, and you eat junk food, and you bond over secrets.'}",

Charles: Oh, so you got dumped, and you didn't see it coming. Oh, brother, you are in Boyle Country. Here's what you're gonna want to do.  Sergeant Jeffords: Come on, Boyle.

"{'Character': 'Jake', 'Episode': 'Gintars', 'QuoteText': ""Jake: Did you make it to the airport in time to see Gintars?  Charles: Yes, but TSA wouldn't let him stay in the country. At least Nikolaj got to spend a few hours with his birth father at a Chili's Too.  Jake: Chili's As Well.""}",

Wax Eagan: I don't need your ID. Federal database is down anyway. Wink wink.  Jake: Ah.  Wax Eagan: So how do you like your ammo? By the box or by the bucket?  Jake: Cool, cool, cool, cool. Our country is broken.""}",
"{'Character': 'Rosa', 'Episode': 'Crime & Punishment', 'QuoteText': ""Captain Holt: Look. I know you're innocent, but fleeing the country is a crime. I could arrest you right here.
